It\'s backed by Meta (formerly Facebook) and has a thriving community.\\n\\n## Key Features We\'re Using\\n\\n### 1. MDX Support\\nMDX allows us to use React components within Markdown files, enabling interactive documentation:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport Tabs from \'@theme/Tabs\';\\nimport TabItem from \'@theme/TabItem\';\\n\\n<Tabs>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"npm\\" label=\\"npm\\">\\n    npm install my-package\\n  </TabItem>\\n  <TabItem value=\\"yarn\\" label=\\"yarn\\">\\n    yarn add my-package\\n  </TabItem>\\n</Tabs>\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Document Versioning\\nAs our projects evolve, we can version our documentation to maintain backward compatibility:\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run docusaurus docs:version 1.0.0\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Blog Support\\nThe built-in blog feature (which you\'re reading right now!) supports:\\n- Author profiles\\n- Reading time estimation\\n- Tags and categories\\n- RSS feeds\\n\\n## Our Setup\\n\\nHere\'s how we structured our documentation:\\n\\n```\\ndocs/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 intro.md\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 initiatives/\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 aluxe-life/\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 tech-blog/\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 ai-tools/\\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 cloud-solutions/\\n```\\n\\n## Custom Styling\\n\\nWe\'ve customized our Docusaurus theme using CSS modules and custom components. Here\'s an example of our custom styling:\\n\\n```css\\n:root {\\n  --ifm-color-primary: #00B2D6;\\n  --ifm-color-primary-dark: #00A0C1;\\n  --brand-navy: #1A1B41;\\n  --brand-cyan: #00B2D6;\\n  --brand-light: #FFFFFF;\\n  --brand-gray: #F5F6F7;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Deployment\\n\\nWe\'re using GitHub Pages for hosting, which makes deployment as simple as:\\n\\n```bash\\nGIT_USER=<username> npm run deploy\\n```\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nWe\'re planning to:\\n- Add search functionality with Algolia DocSearch\\n- Implement versioned documentation for our AI Tools\\n- Create interactive code examples\\n- Add integration with our CI/CD pipeline\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\n- [Docusaurus Documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs)\\n- [Our GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oscarGomes86/nextmove)\\n- [MDX Documentation](https://mdxjs.com/)\\n\\nStay tuned for more technical posts about our development journey!"},{"id":"welcome-to-nextmove","metadata":{"permalink":"/side-hustle/blog/welcome-to-nextmove","editUrl":"https://github.com/oscarGomes86/nextmove/tree/main/blog/2024-03-19-welcome-to-side-hustle-labs.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-19-welcome-to-side-hustle-labs.md","title":"Welcome to NextMove","description":"Welcome to NextMove!
